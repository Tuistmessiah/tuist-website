# Adding sections

Since content is dynamic, the backend should always have the required data to render each section. In case it doesn't, the sections should show a defualt component showing the user a non intrusive message explaining no data exists. The app is arquitected to fetch all data and meta data relevant on a page start and for that page. So any addition of a section in the DB will already appear in that same object fetched for the page.

So when adding a new section to the app, the developer should:

- (React) Create new section component and make a data model of its contents (in JSON form)
- (Backoffice) Add a 'section' entry in the DB with that JSON, with the respective 'page' and 'section' (this is important because this data will come already with the data fetched on page start)
- Pass, through props, all data needed from the object fetched on the page start. Always protect the sections against unfetched data.

### DB considerations

Whenever possible, `mockData/sections` in the backend should reflect also changes in the frontend code. This allows for frontend development using a local database to show all UX content in an appropriate way. Not crucial though.

# React Documentation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
